    "The United States' health care system is in need of significant reform. President Obama introduced the Affordable Care Act in 2010 to provide more afforable and comprehensive health coverage across the nation. It expanded Medicaid, a federal health insurance program, however, almost two million low-income individuals remain uninsured in states that choose to opt-out [1](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/). There are several studies on the demographics that describe this population, but I want to investigate relationship between healthcare costs and the uninsured. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I will be analyzing three datasets from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. The first data set, [CMS Estimated Uninsured People](https://www.kaggle.com/cms/cms-estimated-uninsured-people#the-number-of-estimated-eligible-uninsured-people-for-outreach-targeting.csv) (2096 rows X 52 columns), contains demographic information (age, race, career, language, foodstamps, etc) of uninsured people by county and state. The next two, [CMS State Summary of Outpatient Charge Data](https://www.kaggle.com/cms/cms-state-summary-of-outpatient-charge-data) (1323 x 5) and [CMS State Summary of Inpatient Charge Data](https://www.kaggle.com/cms/cms-state-summary-of-inpatient-charge-data) (5100 rows x 6 columns), contains information about healthcare provider's charges for various inpatient/outpatient treatments by each state.\n",

    "## Part-2: Analysis Strategy and Plans (maximum 200 words):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to investigate the difference in treatment costs across states and determine if there is a significant correlation between provider charges and number of uninsured people in each state. I hypothesize that provider charges will be less correlated to the number of uninsured people compared to demographic factors such as race and income. I expect variations in cost for the same treatment across states and counties. \n",
    "\n",

    "1. Group provider charges by state. (Normalize by state population?)\n",
    "    * This it to see which states have the highest/lowest costs. \n",
    "2. Combine inpatient & outpatient medicare data. Group cost of individual treatments by state. (Normalize by state population?)\n",
    "    * This is to see if the cost individual treatment is the same or different across states. \n",
    "3. Group estimated number of uninsured people by state. (Normalize by state population?)\n",
    "    * This is to see which states have most/least uninsured people. \n",
    "4. Group statistics of race, employment, education level by state.\n",
    "    * Just gathering other demographics to compare against provider charges. \n",
    "5. Run correlations of provider charges, race, employment, and education against number of uninsured people. Rank from most correlated to least correlated. \n",

    "## Part-3: Initial investigations on the data sources (maximum 150 words): \n",
    " \n",
    "For the Estimated Uninsured dataset, I dropped columns concerning language since they were extremely sparse. This reduced the number of columns to 38, but I must reduce further. I used the describe function to get a statistical summary of the remaining fields and will evaluate which are the most relevant. Also, I still need to consolidate data by state.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a visual inspection of the other two datasets, I noticed that the Inpatient/Outpatient tables use state abbreviations (i.e. AZ), but the Estimated Unisured data uses the full name (i.e. Arizona ) . Since I plan to join the datasets on State, I will need to do a conversion. Additionally, it concerns me that the Inpatient Dataset has 5100 rows, but the Outpatient has only 1323 rows. This may be reflective of the domain (more catergories of inpatient treaments versus outpatient treatments), and requires investigation on how this could impact the analysis. \n",
